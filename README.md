Federation Node
===============
             
The Intention
-------------
Bring together the best of the [personal cloud](https://github.com/airships/zephyr/wiki/Personal-Clouds), 
[federated social web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network), 
and [indieweb/POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) protocols, platforms, and applications, 
in an easily deployable server package that can be applied both to standard linux cloud servers 
and also to sub-hundred dollar personal servers such as the currently popular Raspberry Pi.

Server Roles
------------
- _home server_: large file storage, remote access 
  (this may be a low-cost plug computer connected to an external hard drive)
- _web host_: public and federation http server                            
  (A full OpenStack or similar instance with root access)
